    "Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows developers to create and prototype user interfaces (UIs) and APIs for machine learning applications and LLMs quickly and easily. Three reasons it is a great tool are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple and intuitive: Gradio makes it easy to create UIs with minimal code, allowing developers to focus on their models.\n",
    "* Versatile: Gradio supports a wide range of input and output types, making it suitable for various machine learning tasks.\n",
    "* Shareable: Gradio interfaces can be shared with others, enabling collaboration and easy access to your models."
